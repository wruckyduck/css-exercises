<p>Hi, I'm Harry Wruck.</p>

<p>Most people call me Wrucky though.</p>

<p>I started out my life playing football at a high level. I think that taught me a lot about the importance of hard work, and how the people who succeed are the ones who refuse to quit.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, I am interested in businesses, investing and learning more about the world.</p>

<p>I generally try to work hard, be honest, and be a good person.</p>

<p>I studied finance and data science at USYD. I'm a commercial guy. Previously, I spent time working in investment banking, venture investing, and building early stage businesses.</p>

<p>Currently, I am learning to code. You can follow my progress on Github</p>

<p>Next year, I will start work at McKinsey.</p>

<p>If you want to see how I think, I write sometimes on substack. A few articles you might find interesting are: </p>

<ul>
    <li><a class="a" href = "https://capitalists.substack.com/p/building-a-compounding-machine">Building a Compounding Machine (2024)</a></li>
    <li><a class="a" href = "https://capitalists.substack.com/p/venture-buyouts">Venture Buyouts (2024)</a></li>
    <li><a class="a" href = "https://capitalists.substack.com/p/the-economics-of-luxury">The Economics of Luxury (2024)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I like to run marathons and ultramarathons because they make me feel alive. My heroes are people like Shaan Puri, Jordi Hays, and John Fio. People who run companies, have fun, and makes a positive impact on the world.</p>

<p>Sometimes, I host dinners or events for other people with big dreams.</p>

<p>I'm always looking to meet other interesting, ambitious people, so if this resonate with you, feel free to reach out on <a class = "a" href = "linkedin.com/in/hwruck">Linkedin</a>, <a class = "a" href = "https://x.com/wruck_harry">Twitter</a>, or to email me at harrywruck22 at gmail dot com.</p>
